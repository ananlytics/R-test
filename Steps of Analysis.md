# Three basic degrees of analysis

## 1. Descriptive Analysis of Data.
Using Diamonds dataset to find mean and median using a single line code.
```
diamonds %>% summarise(mean_depth=mean(depth),median_depth=median(depth))

```
# Output

```
_# A tibble: 1 x 2
  mean_depth median_depth
       <dbl>        <dbl>
1       61.7         61.8_

```

## 2. Visual Analysis of Data.
Using Diamonds dataset to plot columns using a single line code.
```
ggplot(aes(x=carat,y=price),data=subset(Dia,clarity=="VVS1"))+geom_point(color="Green")+scale_x_discrete(breaks=seq(0,3,0.5))
lm(carat~price, data=Dia)

```
# Output

## 3. Data modelling
Using linear regression to find relationship within data.

```
summary(lm(carat~price, data=Dia))
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm(carat~price, data=Dia))

```
# Output

```

  # Interpretation of above graphs: 
  
  ```ruby
  1. Residuals: The residual data of the simple linear regression model is the difference between the observed
  data of the dependent variable y and the fitted values Å·
  
  2. Q-Q plots: These identify the quantiles in your sample data and plot them against the quantiles of
  a theoretical distribution. In most cases the normal distribution is used, but a Q-Q plot can actually be created
  for any theoretical distribution
  
  3. Scale Location: It takes the square root of the absolute value of standardized residuals instead of plotting the
  residuals themselves. 
  It checks homoscadasticity condition.
  
  4. Residuals vs. leverage plot: It is a type of diagnostic plot that allows us to identify influential observations
  in a regression model.
